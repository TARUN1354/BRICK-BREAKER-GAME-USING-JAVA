Features

- Levels: Proceed into further levels of play as one clears the bricks.
- Score: Whenever you break a brick, your score is updated.
- Life: The player has limited lives, and the game is over whenever he or she runs out of lives.

Controls

- `Left Arrow Key`: Move the paddle to the left.
